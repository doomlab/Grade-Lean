@book{Weiner1992,
abstract = {"Human Motivation qualifies both as a superb textbook for upper- division psychology majors and graduate students and as an important sourcebook for motivational scholars and researchers. ... Readers will be pleased to find that this text is extraordinarily well written, with a style not unlike that of a good novel. Other desirable features, from a teaching perspective, are 12 illustrative experiments for students to complete and interspersed biographical sketches of eminent motivational theorists. ... Bernard Weiner's volume represents the culmination of years of research and scholarship and will offer an array of insights to students who are more advanced. It is also likely to be used as a motivation sourcebook for years to come."--Contemporary Psychology Use the quote above for next mailing 9/93 "This is a truly outstanding work, comprehensive in its coverage and innovative in its approach. By using the device of metaphor, Bernard Weiner has brilliantly clarified the relationship among the different theoretical perspectives on motivation. Encompassing both research and theory, the volume surveys classical and recent motivation theories, and culminates in an exciting and challenging new perspective. The book qualifies both as a highly attractive text and as an essential volume for all motivational psychologists. Highly recommended. This brilliant work effectively communicates the excitement of research on the 'whys' of human behavior, a field to which Weiner himself has been a major contributor. Rather than just presenting one theory after another Weiner has organized them in an original and easy-to-comprehend fashion."--Paul McReynolds, Emeritus Professor, University of Nevada--Reno. Ch. 1.

abstract = {Examined the impact of students' grade expectations on their evaluations of instructors' performance. 444 undergraduate students (aged 18–22 yrs) supplied demographic information and completed instructor evaluations concerning graduate teaching fellows 3–4 wks into the course and 2nd evaluations on the university's official evaluation form at 13 wks. Results show that Ss expecting to receive F grades significantly lowered their instructors' evaluations. Those Ss expecting A or B grades significantly raised their instructors' evaluations. Findings suggest that instructors receive higher ratings, in part, because they are more lenient in their grade assignment. It is concluded that there is a significant relationship between the grades students expect to receive and their subsequent evaluation of instruction.},

abstract = {The current increased interest in evaluating the teaching of college and university faculty has made course evaluations even more important to the careers of academic faculty. The most important use of teaching evaluations is to guide instructors in revising courses and altering teaching methods to become more effective educators. A second use is becoming more frequent: comparing scores on teaching evaluations across faculty to make major personnel decisions, including hiring, firing, promotion, and tenure. The soundness of these decisions depends upon the validity of the evaluation instrument, and even the most reliable and consistent instrument can easily be compromised if administered inappropriately. Based on a review of the literature, I list 20 ways to compromise teaching evaluations and improve ratings without improving teaching.},

abstract = {In a trans-paradigm theoretical synthesis of cognitive dissonance research, we examined theoretical variables (e.g., choice, consequences, etc.) and their relationships with dissonance effect sizes. We used structural equation analyses, performed within and across five research paradigms (induced compliance, insufficient justification, disconfirmed expectancies, selective exposure, and free choice), and corresponding to major versions of cognitive dissonance theory, to test several theoretically derived models. None of these models supported Festinger's notion that discomfort mediates dissonance effects. Consistent with conceptualisation of guilt as the drive component of dissonance theory, guilt strongly predicted dissonance effect sizes, virtually irrespective of which model was tested. A theory integrating the guilt and dissonance theories is stronger than either set of theories in isolation.},
