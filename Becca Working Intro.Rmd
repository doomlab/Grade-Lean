####INTRODUCTION

Student evaluations of professors have been disputed over time with regard to validity and reliability. The impact of student evaluations on professor advancement can be great and can often act as a deciding factor in professor promotion or demotion, along with the access to funding opportunities, coursework choice, and tenureship. There are certain variables researched that result in improving evaluations, such as giving higher grades [@Greenwald1997; @Isely2005; @Krautmann1999]. Further, (Neath 1996) suggests 20 tips in which professors may bolster their evaluations from students that have no relationship with proven instructional methods or further learning retention among the student body. Engaging in these steps to improve evaluations further adds to the argument that student evaluations may not necessarily be measuring whether the instructional methods of professors are sound, rather measuring whether or not the professor is likeable among the students. 

However, some authors [@Centra2003; @Marsh1987; @Marsh2000] have discovered professors are not able to increase their positive evaluations by providing their students with higher grades. We believe this is due to what we consider the effect of "perceived grading". We operationally define perceived grading as the students' perceptions of assignment appropriateness, grading fairness, and the expected course grade at the time the evaluations are being completed. We believe social psychology theory would support that students with low perceived grading can reduce cognitive dissonance and engage in ego defense by giving low evaluations of professors who give them lower grades [@Maurer2006] resulting in decreased validity and reliability of the construct, professor instruction. We argue that both social psychology theory and the evidence from student evaluations supports that higher perceived grading can lead to better student evaluations of instruction. This theory and evidence from student evaluation leads us to further posit student evaluations of professors as biased methods of data collection and irrelevant to the quality of the instructor and the instructional methods used over the course of a semester. 

Much of the literature on student evaluations involves diverse and complex analyses (e.g., @Marsh1987) and lacks social-psychological theoretical guidance on human judgment. To expect that student evaluations would not be influenced by expected grade would contradict a long-standing history of social psychology research on cognitive dissonance, attribution, and ego threat. Failure threatens the ego [@Miller1985; Snyder, Stephan & Rosenfield, 1978] and motivates us to find rationales to defend the ego. Failing students, or those performing below personal expectations, would be expected to defend their ego by attributing low grades to poor teaching or unfair evaluation practices [@Maurer2006]. One common strategy involves diminishing the value of the activity [@Miller1989], which would result in lowered value of a course.

Similarly, Cognitive Dissonance Theory [@Festinger1957] predicts that people who experience poor performance but perceive themselves as competent will experience dissonance, by which they can reduce through negative evaluations of the instruction [@Maurer2006]. Attribution research [@Weiner1992] also supports the argument that among low achievement motivation students, failure is associated with external attributions for cause, and the most plausible external attribution is the quality of instruction and grading practices. Although arguments regarding degree of influence are reasonable, the position that they are not affected is inconsistent with existing and established theory. Thus, it is not surprising that the majority of faculty perceive student evaluations to be biased by perceived grading and course choice [@Marsh1987].

Considerable research has been conducted in support of widely distributed evaluation systems. @Centra2003 reported that in a study of 9,194 class averages using the Student Instructional Support, the relationship between expected grades and global ratings was only .20. He further argued that when variance due to perceived learning outcomes was regressed from the global evaluation, the effect of expected grades was eliminated. However, a student’s best assessment of "perceived learning outcome" is their expected grade, and thus, these should be highly correlated. When perceived learning is regressed from the global evaluations, it is not surprising that suppression effects would eliminate or could even reverse the correlation between expected grade and global evaluation. In general, there are several reasons why the relationship of expected grade to global evaluations is suppressed. For example, faculty ratings are generally very high on average (i.e. quality instructors are hired), which restricts variation; thus, weakening their reliability as a measure of teacher attributes. This restriction in range suppresses correlation.

Perhaps a more significant reason the grade/evaluation effect is often minimized in research is due to the confusion between leniency in perceived grading and expected grade. We describe this concept as grading leniency because the inflated grades are higher than grade descriptors would imply. The grading system in the university where data were collected describes a C as "Average" and a B as "Above Average". @Isely2005 demonstrated that student evaluations are influenced by the difference between expected grade and the student’s GPA. Expected grade is experienced by the student as leniency to the extent it reflects differences from course expectations based upon course effort and typical grades for the student. The authors recognize that many professors would argue that they give the majority of their students As because they are extraordinary teachers or because they use a mastery system designed to allow all students to receive an A. This ideology reflects an abandonment of grades as a means to differentiate students, a departure from "C = average", and a lack of matching levels of challenge to the achievement potential of students. For our purposes, we refer to it as leniency to the extent that grading is above the university standard of "C = average". 

@Marsh1987 argued that the individual is not the proper unit of analysis because such analyses could suggest false findings related to individual differences in students. Therefore, he argued the use of class as the suggested unit of analysis. We agree, both for his reasoning and because analyses with individual ratings can mask significant relationships as well. Individual differences in expectancy will attenuate the correlation less when class average is used as the unit of analysis. To the extent that the same class average would be expected across all courses, an assumption we will challenge, the class average for expected grade is a good measure of perceived grading as an instructor attribute. Course quality, not individual attributes of students, is what we are attempting to assess when we are using student evaluations of courses. Several studies provide support that when class is the unit of analysis, expected grade is a more significant biasing factor in student evaluations [@Blackhart2006; @DuCette1982; @Ellis2003].

@Blackhart2006 analyzed 167 psychology classes in a multiple regression analysis with class as the unit of analysis and found that the two most significant predictors of instructor ratings were average grade given by the instructor and instructor status (TA or rank of faculty). Because of the limited number of classes, the power of the analysis was limited. However, in addition to the concern regarding the relationship between grades and global course evaluations, it was found that TAs were rated more highly than ranked faculty. This finding raises additional questions on validity. We must either accept that the least trained and qualified teachers are actually better teachers, or we must believe this result suggests that student evaluations have given us false information on the quality of teaching via their perceptions of grading.

@DuCette1982 provided evidence that using course as a unit of analysis increased the correlation between expected grade and other course ratings. Within specific groupings of classes, these correlations ranged from .23 to .53. Two factors limited the level of their relationships. First, the classes used were all upper division courses and graduate courses. Secondly, over 90% of the students in these classes expected an A or a B. Consequently, the correlations between expected grade and global course ratings would be reduced due to the absence of variation in expected grades. Similarly, @Ellis2003 found a correlation of .35 between average course grade and average rating of the instructor in 165 classes during a two-year period. However, these studies did not consider the predictive relationship for instructors across different courses and semesters.

Different disciplines and subject areas have diverse GPA standards, and students have differing grade and workload expectations in different courses as well. For example, an instructor in Anatomy giving a 3.00 GPA might be considered lenient while an Education instructor giving a 3.25 GPA might be considered hard (examples for illustration only). To have a valid measure of workload and leniency factors, correlations should be conducted with varied teachers of the same course. Further, different populations take courses in different disciplines, resulting in potential population differences between anatomy classes and education classes, which could create or mask findings as well. Hence, analysis of these correlations within the same discipline and course was expected to strengthen the relationship between expected grades and quality measures, offering more valid results. 

In most studies of student evaluations, reliability is established through internal consistency reliability. However, this form of reliability is confounded with halo effects (i.e. a cognitive bias that influences ratings based on an overall perception of the person teaching, rather than the individual components of the course), and tells only whether the individual responding to the questions is consistent and reliable. By having many different classes for the same instructor, we can establish the reliability of ratings across the same and different courses during the same and different semesters. Student ratings cannot be considered a valid measure of an instructor’s teaching skills if they are unable to reliably differentiate instructors. 

If ratings are valid measures of instructor attributes, it should be expected that ratings would have some stability across semester and course taught. If variation were due to instructor attributes and not the course they are assigned, we would expect ratings to be most stable across two different courses during the same semester. We would expect these correlations to decline somewhat for the same course in a different semester, since faculty members may improve or decline with experience. But if they are reliable and stable enough to use in making choices about retention, their stability should be demonstrated across different semesters as well. Therefore, we first sought to establish reliability of ratings for the instructors across courses and semesters. 

In the current study, we used data collected over a 20-year period to allow for more powerful analyses, with such analyses occurring within many sections of the same course. After examining reliability, we sought to show that items on instructor evaluations were positively correlated for undergraduate and graduate students, demonstrating that overall course evaluations are related to perceptions of grading and expected grade. We also expected correlations to be substantially higher than those obtained by researchers who used individual students as their unit of analysis. Next, we examined if rating differences across these questions were found between types of instructors compared to full-time faculty, such as teaching-assistants and per-course faculty. The presumption of university hiring requirements that include a terminal degree for regular faculty is that better-trained faculty will be more effective teachers. Therefore, if student evaluations are a valid measure, better-trained full-time faculty should receive higher ratings than per-course instructors and teaching assistants. However, existing literature appears to contradict this expectation [@Blackhart2006]. Given these differences, we proposed and examined a moderated mediation analysis to portray the expected relationship of the variables across instructor type.

# Discussion

The findings support the model that student evaluations of Psychology faculty are related to what one might consider leniency (i.e., overall average scores of B) in grading through perceptions of assignment appropriateness, grading fairness, and the expected course grade. This position is supported both in the strong relationships between expected grade and global ratings by the evidence that greater training and experience is related to poorer evaluations, lower expected grades, and lower relationships between grading and evaluations. Faculty received lower scores than teaching assistants in every category and often lower scores than per-course faculty, but not instructors. Mediation analyses showed that expected grade is positively related to overall course ratings, although this relationship is mediated by the perceived grading in the course. Therefore, as students have higher expected grades, the perceived grading scores increase, and the overall course score also increases. Moderation of this mediation effect indicated differences in the strength of the relationships between expected grade, grading questions, and overall course rating, wherein faculty generally had weaker relationships between these variables. 

Because the study was not experimental, causal conclusions from this study alone need to be limited. However, @Salmons1993 provides some evidence of the causal direction of student ratings of instructors and expected grades. She had 444 students complete faculty evaluations after 3-4 weeks of classes, and again after 13 weeks. Students who expected to get Fs significantly lowered their evaluations while students who expected to receive As and Bs significantly raised their evaluations. 

It is compelling that the correlations suggest that we can do a better job of understanding global ratings, perception of exams, fairness, and appropriateness of assignments based upon what grade students expected as compared to relating these ratings using ratings for the same course in a different semester or ratings for a different course in the same semester for instructor (i.e., correlations between items in the same semester are higher than reliability estimates across the board). It is very likely that these correlations with expected grade are suppressed by the loading of scores at the high end of the scale for course ratings and expected grade. Generally, evaluation items reflect scores at the high end of the 1-5 scale (see Table 3) even when items are intentionally constructed to move evaluators from the ends. The item, "The overall quality of this course was among the top 20% of those I have taken," is conspicuously designed to move subjects away from the top rating. Yet average global ratings remain about a 4.00. The grade expectation average was approximately 4.00, which relates to a B average or 3.00 GPA. 

One way of establishing convergent validity would be a finding that better trained and more experienced teachers get higher ratings than less well trained instructors. If the measure were valid, we would expect that regular faculty and full time instructors would get higher ratings than per course faculty and teaching assistants. To argue otherwise is to challenge the merits of higher education units with a faculty of professors with doctoral status. If the university were a researcher powerhouse where faculty research is emphasized over teaching and graduate assistants are admitted from the highest ranks of undergraduates, the finding that teaching assistants and per course faculty get higher ratings might be less of a challenge to the validity of these ratings. However, the university at which the data were collected is a non-doctoral program with greater emphasis on teaching and moderate emphasis on research, and teaching assistants are master’s candidates with less substantial admission expectations than doctoral programs. Hence, these findings challenge the convergent validity of the teaching evaluations.

Like most studies in this area, a major limitation is the absence of an independent measure of learning. Of course, this limitation is based upon the belief that the goal is to create educated persons, not just satisfied consumers. Even when common tests are used, these are invalid if the instructors are aware of the course content. Teachers seeking high evaluations are able to improve their ratings and scores by directly addressing the content of the specific test items. ETS now allows faculty who administer Major Field Tests to access the specific items which thereby invalidates it as a measure for these purposes. Ultimately, answering questions about the validity of student evaluations is a daunting task without such measures. 

Evidence suggests that student evaluations are influenced by likability, attractiveness, and dress [@Buck1989; @HughFeeley2002; @Gurung2007] in addition to leniency and low demands [@Greenwald1997]. One must question whether a factor like instructor warmth, which relates to student evaluation [@Best2000], is really fitting to the ultimate purposes of a college education. In a unique setting where student assignments to courses were random and common tests were used, @Carrell2010 demonstrated that teaching strategies that enhanced student evaluations led to poorer performance in subsequent classes. With the sum of invalid variance from numerous factors being potentially high, establishment of a high positive relationship to independent measures of achievement is essential to the acceptance of student evaluations as a measure of teaching quality. 

Perception of the influence of leniency on teacher evaluations is far more detrimental to the quality of education than the biased evaluations themselves. It is unlikely that good teachers, even if more challenging, will get bad evaluations (i.e. evaluations where the majority of students rate the course poorly). Good teachers are rarely losing their positions due to low quality evaluations. But @Marsh1987 found that faculty perceives evaluations to be biased based upon course difficulty (72%), expected grade (68%), and course workload (60%). If one’s goal is high merit ratings and teaching awards, and the most significant factor is student evaluations of teaching, then putting easier and low-level questions on the test, adding more extra credit, cutting the project expectations, letting students off the hook for missing deadlines, and boosting borderline grades would all be likely strategies for boosting evaluations. 

Effective teachers will get positive student ratings even when they have high expectations and do not inflate grades. But, many excellent teachers will score below average. It is maladaptive to try to increase a 3.90 global rating to a 4.10, because it often requires that the instructor try to emphasize avoidance of the lowest rating (1.00) because these low ratings in a skewed distribution have in inordinate influence on the mean. This effort of competing against the norms is likely to lead to grade inflation and permissiveness for the least motivated and most negligent students. Some researchers [@Ellis2003; @Greenwald1997] argue that student evaluations of instruction should be adjusted on the basis of grades assigned. However, there are problems with such an approach. The regression Betas are likely to differ based upon course and many other factors. In our research and in research by DuCettte and Kenney (1982), substantial variation in correlations was found across different course sets. Establishing valid adjustments would be problematic at best. Further, such an approach would punish instructors when they happen to get an unusually intelligent and motivated class (or teach an honors class) and give students the grades they deserve. Student evaluations are not a proper motivational factor for instructors in grade assignment, whether it is to inflate or deflate grades.

It would seem nearly impossible to eliminate invalid bias in student ratings of instruction. Yet, they may tell us a teacher is ineffective when the majority give poor ratings. It is the normative, competitive use that makes student evaluations of teaching subject to problematic interpretation. This finding is especially critical in light of recent research that portrays that student evaluations are largely biased against female teachers, and that student bias in evaluation is related to course discipline and student gender [@Boring2016]. @Boring2016 also examine the difficulty in adjusting faculty evaluation for bias and determined that the complex nature of ratings makes unbiased evaluation nearly impossible. @Stark2014 further explain that evaluations are often negatively related to more objective measures of teaching effectiveness, and biased additionally by perceived attractiveness and ethnicity. In line with the current paper, he suggests dropping overall teaching effectiveness or value of the course type questions because they are influenced by many variables unrelated to actual teaching. Last, they suggest the distribution and response rate of the data are critical information, and this point becomes particularly important when recent research shows that online evaluations of teaching experience a large drop in response rates [@Stanny2017]. Our study contributes to the literature of how student evaluations are a misleading and unsuccessful measure of teaching effectiveness, especially focusing on reliability and the impact of grading on overall questions. We conclude that it may be possible to manipulate these values by lowering teaching standards, which implies that high stakes hiring and tenure decisions should probably follow the advice of @Palmer2014 or @Stanny2015 in implementing teaching portfolios and syllabus review, particularly because a recent meta-analysis of student evaluations showed they are unrelated to student learning [@Uttl2017].
